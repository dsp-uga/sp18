								<h2>Overview</h2>
								<p>
									<span class="image right">
										<img src="images/data_everywhere.jpg" alt="" />
									</span>
								</p>

								<p>
									This course aims to provide students with real-world data
									science experience. Students form teams, design data science
									pipelines from the ground-up, and compete to achieve the
									highest validation accuracy on a hidden test set.
								</p>
							</section>

							<hr />
							<section>
								<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

								<p>
									Machine learning, statistics, linear algebra, and software
									engineering knowledge are essential. Courses that would
									satisfy these prerequisites include:

									<ul>
										<li>
											<a href="http://www.cs.uga.edu/courses/csci-43806380">CSCI 4380/6380</a>
										</li>
										<li>
											<a href="https://www.capa.uga.edu/cgi/Capa/BrowsePrefix_DisplayCourse.exe?32634I32634">CSCI 4360/6360</a>
										</li>
										<li>
											<a href="http://cs.uga.edu/courses/csci-40506050">CSCI 4050/6050</a>
										</li>
									</ul>
								</p>

								<h2>Grading</h2>
								<p>
									<span class="image right"><img src="images/relevant_interests.jpg" alt="" /></span>

									<ul>
										<li>Projects: <strong>75%</strong></li>
										<li>Final Project: <strong>25%</strong></li>
									</ul>
								</p>

								<p>
									There will be 4 team projects, each worth 18.75% of the total.
									Each project will be graded on both "theory" and "engineering"
									components. Teams will start with a grade of 85% (B); provided
									their solution adheres to a baseline standard, that is the grade
									they will receive. For more points, teams must go "above and beyond"
									the baseline.
								</p>
								<p>
									<ul>
										<li>
											The baseline theory grade will entail implementing the suggested
											strategy in each project handout. This will usually be a simple
											algorithm that, if correctly implemented, will confer a
											reasonable test performance.
										</li>
										<li>
											The baseline engineering grade will entail i) well-designed,
											modular code, ii) good documentation (in the code, in a
											README file, and on the GitHub wiki), and iii) effective
											team dynamics (division of labor in a CONTRIBUTORS file,
											good use of git commit comments, use of GitHub issue
											tracker).
										</li>
									</ul>

									Examples of going "above and beyond" include, but are not limited
									to i) implementing a sufficiently different algorithm
									(cite the paper), ii) obtaining outstanding test performance,
									iii) using continuous integration tools, iv) designing unit
									tests, v) a permissive open source license (in a LICENSE file),
									vi) a project website, vii) using linters to adhere to style
									standards, viii) creating and successfully hitting milestones
									in the issue tracker, ix) packaging your project for distribution
									(e.g. through pip or conda-forge), or x) providing outstanding
									documentation (e.g. usage examples, install instructions, a
									"quickstart" guide, comparison to other similar methods, etc).
								</p>
								<p>
									There will also be an introductory "Project 0" that aims to
									familiarize students with the technical infrastructure of the course;
									this is required but will not be graded.
								</p>

								<p>
									There will be 1 final project. Like the "regular" projects,
									it will also be team-based. Unlike the other projects, however,
									students will be able to choose the project their team works
									on. The final project consists of three components:

									<ul>
										<li>
											<strong>Proposal</strong>: A 2-page (maximum) document,
											outlining the core idea of the project, expected outcomes,
											and how success will be be evaluated. A progress update
											a few weeks after the proposal submission will be
											considered part of the proposal.
										</li>
										<li>
											<strong>Presentation</strong>: A 25-minute scientific
											talk to the rest of the class, describing your project,
											your approach, and your results. Students are encouraged
											to be creative in how they deliver the presentation, e.g.
											by including live demos or code walkthroughs.
										<li>
											<strong>Deliverables</strong>: A 6-10 page
											<a href="https://nips.cc/Conferences/2016/PaperInformation/StyleFiles">NIPS-style</a>
											paper that thoroughly describes the complete project. This
											also includes the final code for the project.
										</li>
									</ul>

								<h2>Materials</h2>

								<p>
									<span class="image right">
										<img src="images/grumpy_cat.jpg" alt="" />
									</span>
								</p>

								<h3>GitHub</h3>
								<p>
									All course materials will be posted here, and all project
									repositories should be created and maintained here (whether
									they are private or public is up to you, but they should
									be part of the course's GitHub organization account). You
									can access the organization account through this link:
								</p>

								<p style="margin-left: 30px;">
									<strong>
										<a href="https://github.com/dsp-uga">https://github.com/dsp-uga</a>
									</strong>
								</p>

								<p>
									The specific repository for the Spring 2018 course materials
									is located <a href="https://github.com/dsp-uga/sp18">here</a>.
								</p>

								<h3>AutoLab</h3>
								<p>
									This is where you submit the output of your code for each
									project (except the final project). You can access it via the
									link:
								</p>

								<p style="margin-left: 30px;">
									<strong>
										<a href="https://autolab.cs.uga.edu/">https://autolab.cs.uga.edu</a>
									</strong>
								</p>

								<p>
									Remember: if you have problems accessing AutoLab,
									<strong>check that you're either on UGA's campus network or
									are connected to it via VPN</strong>. If neither of these
									are true,
									<a href="https://eits.uga.edu/access_and_security/infosec/tools/vpn/">you
										can check out EITS' instructions for getting set up with VPN</a>.
									If one of them IS true, let me know and we'll see about sorting
									it out.
								</p>

								<h3>Slack</h3>

								<p>
									This is where I make will make critical course announcements,
									so please ensure you are subscribed.
								</p>

								<p>
									This is the primary point of interaction for asking for and
									offering help. I will answer questions when I can, but also
									I encourage everyone to help each other out, too!
								</p>

								<p>
									I also get inundated with emails on a daily basis, so using
									Slack to ask questions effectively acts as a filter: I'll
									most likely respond to a Slack question more quickly than I
									would by email.
								</p>

								<p style="margin-left: 30px;">
									<strong>
										<a href="https://eds-uga-csci8360.slack.com/">https://eds-uga-csci8360.slack.com/</a>
									</strong>
								</p>

								<p>
									If you are not in the Slack chat, contact me with your
									preferred email address to be invited.

								<h2>Policies</h2>

								<p>
									<span class="image right">
										<img src="images/hermione.jpg" alt="" />
									</span>
								</p>

								<p>
									Projects are due by 11:59:59pm on the noted date; after that
									time, AutoLab will no longer accept submissions. Furthermore,
									no commits to GitHub repositories after the stated time will
									be considered when grading.
								</p>

								<p>
									If you run into problems with your teammates, you first need
									to work with them and determine a course of action that is
									beneficial for everyone. If you and your teammates are still
									unable to reach a consensus, I am happy to help. But the
									bottom line is: your entire team sinks or swims together.
									There are no individual grades on the projects, so work with
									each other, not against one another.
								</p>

								<p>
									The presence or absence of any form of help or collaboration,
									whether given or received, must be explicitly stated and
									disclosed in full by all involved, on the first page of their
									assignment ("I did not give or receive any help on this
									assignment" or "I helped [person] with [specific task].").
									Collaboration without full disclosure will be handled
									severely; except in usual extenuating circumstances, my
									policy is to fail the student(s) for the entire course.
								</p>

								<p>
									The simple version is: don't copy code or even previous
									solutions. Given the nature of this course and the need for
									ground-truth data on the verification end, chances are high
									you can find similar projects in the wild. Resist that urge;
									it will be obvious, and we'll have to have an awkward
									conversation that won't end well.
								</p>

								<p>DO NOT COPY CODE. Don't do it.</p>
